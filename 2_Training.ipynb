    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of two submodels: encoding CNN that transforms spatial features into embedding and decoding RNN that converts this feature embedding into a caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoding CNN is a pre-trained ResNet101 with the last layer changed to linear (fully connected). Linear layer has the same number of features as the word embedding in LSTM. I tried architecture with 1 linear + RELU + dropout 0.5 + 1 output linear on top of the ResNet. Unfortunately results were substantially  worse then with only one output layer. I suppose that pretrained network has some overfitting prevention and we need to train only a simple one-layer encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decoding RNN is a standard LSTM model with some tuning. It is known that caption generation datasets are small and decoder tends to overfit. To overcome that I added dropout in LSTM and dropout before the output linear layer. According to http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/msoh.pdf the  model  parameters were fixed at dropout keep-probability = 0.75  and number of layers = 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " `batch_size` - the typical batch sizes are 32*n, n=1,2,... We have relatively small NN so I had choosen batch size 256 because it fits well in my GPU memory (8Gb). I know that many recommend smaller batch sizes (32 to be precise - https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-mini-batch-gradient-descent-configure-batch-size/). However most of that recommendations are for the image processing where a number of learnable parameters of NNs is huge and every epoch is time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "`vocab_threshold` was set to 4 to keep vocabulary size under 10000\n",
    "\n",
    "Next two hyperparameters were set according to the article _Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator_ (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "`embed_size` (word embedding dimension) was set to 512\n",
    "\n",
    "`hidden_size` (hidden layer dimension) was set to 512\n",

    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I used pretrained ResNet101 and my input have to meet its requirement. According to Pytorch documentation (https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/), all pre-trained models expect input mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be at least 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Provided `transform_train` does just that. I tried to use CenterCrop instead of RandomCrop (as it is shown at https://github.com/pytorch/examples/imagenet/main.py) but saw no difference in training quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the choosen models of CNN and RNN  I have to train:\n",
    "\n",
    "* all parameters of RNN \n",
    "\n",
    "* final linear layer of CNN that I added instead of standard classification layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning these parameters allows to learn mapping between spatial features from pretrained ResNet101 and a sequence of words in captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried three optimizers: SGD, RMSprop and ADAM. My expirience showed that SGD (with or without momentum) converges slowly on minibatches with more then 32 images. RMPprop was more or less on par with ADAM with batch size equals to 100. I decided to go with ADAM because it converges slightly faster on large minibatches."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
